No compilation instructions, should "just work" on any FreeBSD 4.x
or 5.x box.  Usage is similar to jail(8), for jail setup instructions
read that manpage as well as jail(2).

The last argument to jailinit is the IP you want to allow connections
from.  You can connect from this IP to give jailinit commands, try
'help'.  Omitting this argument will cause jailinit to forget that it's
capable of playing with sockets. If jailinit is allowing connections
it opens port 1 on the ip used for the jail.

To kill a jail send jailinit the TERM signal, to restart a jail send it
a HUP.

Jailinit was designed to work with a process that monitors and keeps
track of jails, jailproc, but will work without.  Jailproc is not yet
implemented.
