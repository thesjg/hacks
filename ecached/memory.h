/**
 *
 * This allocator creates 6 zones for storing chunks of data up to several
 * powers of 8, those between 8 and 262144. Each zone is represented as a
 * series of buckets, with each bucket able to store data sized up to the
 * stride of the zone it is in.
 *
 * Underlying each zone is an mmap(2)'ed file descriptor that has been
 * unlink(2)'ed. This arrangement allows us to grow each zone independently
 * with relative ease. Buckets are allocated in blocks of 32 and information
 * regarding the free/used state of a bucket is maintained in a heap-allocated
 * 32-bit bitmask. This makes the allocation granularity range from 256 bytes
 * to 8 megabytes.
 *
 * Each zone is initially allocated a single set of buckets, so sparse
 * allocation overhead at program startup is 9,586,944 bytes.
 *
 * The rationale behind using unlinked file-backed mmap allocations versus
 * more typical methods is that this method enables the use of zero-copy
 * mechanisms for sending data.
